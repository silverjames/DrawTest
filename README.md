# DrawTest
This is a swift test app that I used to create a good rendition of the squiggle shape needed for the set game.

I draw the squiggle with three cubic bezier curves and three quadratic bezier curves. For all 15 points I have made the x and y coordinates inspectable, and the view designable, so you can get a live preview of all your changes. Feel free to use and modify for your taste! 

relevant for solving the Hegarty Stanford cs193p course tasks
